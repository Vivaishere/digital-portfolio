### Things I learned
- how to reference images in md
- how to create grids and equations in md
- how run a jupyter book in the browser

### Things I found difficult
- Understanding how all the files interact with each other
- Inserting image/figures into md, I was confused about how to use the syntax until it worked; only after that did I understand what I was doing wrong.
- I would like to practice all the different areas we covered as to be more proficient and understand every action in depth.
